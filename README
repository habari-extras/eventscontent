- Available additional variables for theming (all via $yourpost->info->variablename):
eventdate - the event's date as unix timestamp
eventtime - the event's time as unix timestamp
eventdate_out - the event's date in a readable format (see 0.2)
eventtime_out - the event's time in a readable format (see 0.2)
location
eventtag

Since 0.3:
- Create event posts that have location, time and date, and a tag for grouping multiple posts dealing with the same event
- Search posts by location: In the admin interface, type location:xxx into the search field. For the frontend, access http://yourblog.tld/yourhabarifolder/location/xxx
- Search posts by event: Same as location, but it's eventtag:xxx and /eventtag/xxx
- Output preformatted dates: Use $post->info->eventdate_out to display the event's date properly (it uses the system's default format or, if a user is logged in, the user's format)
- Same for eventtime_out
